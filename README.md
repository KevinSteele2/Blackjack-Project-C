# Blackjack

This is my blackjack project! It is an implementation of the card game.


## Overview

The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. You input either 'hit' or 'stand'. If you hit, you will be dealt a card. If you stand, it will be the dealer's turn.


## Building the project

To build the project, you must have GCC installed on your system. Navigate to the directory you have the project downloaded in. Then, you can use the provided makefile to compile, just type 'make' into the terminal. The name of the executable will be 'playbj' or 'playbj.exe'.

To run it, use the following command: './playbj' or './playbj.exe'.

 
## Details

This project was designed and tested using c11.
