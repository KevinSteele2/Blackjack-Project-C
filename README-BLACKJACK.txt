# Blackjack

This is my blackjack project! It is an implementation of the card game.


## Overview

The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. You input either 'hit' or 'stand'. If you hit, you will be dealt a card. If you stand, it will be the dealer's turn.


## Building the project

To build the project, you must have GCC installed on your system. Then, you can use the provided makefile to compile. The name of the executable will be 'playbj'.

To run it, use the following command: './playbj'

 
## Details

This project was designed and tested using c11.
